Status: Draft

Discussion: https://groups.google.com/g/stellar-dev/c/hPhkXhrl5-Y/m/ZF6eJcqKAgAJ
Protocol version: TBD
```

## Simple Summary

This proposal provides the Issuer with a means to clawback (and reissue if desired)
assets in order to support regulatory requirements. This function can be used to: 

1) recover assets that have been fraudulently obtained 
2) respond to regulatory actions, if required 
3) enable identity proofed persons to recover an enabled asset
in the event of loss of key custody or theft. 

The proposal does not involve shared
custody of the person’s account and does not affect custody of bearer assets in 
the persons account.

## Working Group

This protocol change was initially authored by Dan Doney and Tomer Weller. The working group include other authors and the consulted persons include key individuals familiar with the implementation of the core protocol and maintainers of Horizon and its SDKs.

## Motivation

In order to meet securities regulatory requirements in many jurisdictions globally, 
the issuer (or designated transfer agent) must be able to demonstrate the ability 
to revoke assets in the event of a mistaken or fraudulent transaction or other 
regulatory action regarding a specific person or asset wide. To receive approval, 
the Issuer must demonstrate the ability to perform this action with or without the 
permission of the affected person. Unlike approaches that involve multiple 
signatures on the person’s wallet (brokerage clawback), this approach does not 
compromise the custody of other assets in the person’s wallet. Additionally, this 
approach is an improvement over an approach that invalidates the trustline. While 
trustline invalidation freezes assets, tokens (asset shares) remain in circulation 
compromising accounting models. The approach has other benefits to owners of the 
affected asset including the ability to recover assets if wallet custody is lost 
including the important business continuity mitigations in the loss of control of 
custodial or omnibus account.

### Goals Alignment

This CAP is aligned with the following Stellar Network Goals:

- The Stellar Network should be secure and reliable.

- The Stellar Network should enable cross-border payments, i.e. payments via 
exchange of assets, throughout the globe, enabling users to make payments between 
assets in a manner that is fast, cheap, and highly usable.

## Abstract

This proposal adds a new flag to the Issuing account and introduces a new `CLAWBACK`
operation. The `CLAWBACK_ENABLED` flag on the issuing account must be set to 
authorize a `CLAWBACK` operation submitted by the Issuing account.  The `CLAWBACK` 
operation results in the removal of the specified assets issued from the 
designated account. The `CLAWBACK` operation only applies to assets issued by the 
source account. Assets with clawback enabled can be easily distinguished from 
traditional blockchain assets (bearer instruments) so that asset owners are aware 
of rights. The transaction may result in revocation of some or all of the specified 
assets from the designated account based on the amount provided in the `CLAWBACK` 
operation. In a future proposal, we will outline an approach by which the same flag 
can be used to execute a ROLLBACK of a transaction (within a designated time window) 
in the event of a fraudulent or mistaken transaction.

## Specification

### XDR changes

```c
enum AccountFlags
{
    AUTH_IMMUTABLE = 1,                                      
    AUTH_REQUIRED = 2,                                  
    AUTH_REVOCABLE = 4,                                  
    AUTH_CLAWBACKABLE = 8
};

struct ClawbackOp 
{
    union switch (AssetType type)
    {
    // ASSET_TYPE_NATIVE is not allowed
    case ASSET_TYPE_CREDIT_ALPHANUM4:
        AssetCode4 assetCode4;
    case ASSET_TYPE_CREDIT_ALPHANUM12:
        AssetCode12 assetCode12;
    } asset; // asset code to claw back. asset issuer is implied from source account.  
    MuxedAccount from;
    int64 amount;
};

enum ClawbackResultCode
{
    // codes considered as "success" for the operation
    CLAWBACK_SUCCESS = 0,
 
    // codes considered as "failure" for the operation
    CLAWBACK_MALFORMED = -1,
    CLAWBACK_NO_TRUST = -2,
    CLAWBACK_DISABLED = -3,
    CLAWBACK_UNDERFUNDED = -4
};

enum OperationType
{
    CREATE_ACCOUNT = 0,
    ...
    REVOKE_SPONSORSHIP = 18,
    CLAWBACK = 19
};
 
struct Operation
{
 
    MuxedAccount* sourceAccount;
 
    union switch (OperationType type)
    {
    case CREATE_ACCOUNT:
        CreateAccountOp createAccountOp;
    ...
    case REVOKE_SPONSORSHIP:
        RevokeSponsorshipOp revokeSponsorshipOp;
    case CLAWBACK:
    	ClawbackOp clawbackOp;
    }
 
    body;
};
```

### Semantics
In order to execute a clawback, an issuer account must be clawback enabled. Once
enabled, the issuer submits a `ClawbackOp` operation from the account containing
the asset to be clawed back to the desired destination. This operation does not
require the affected account’s signature. The transaction results in a change in
balance to the recipient’s account. 
 
#### Account
This proposal requires the addition of `AUTH_CLAWBACKABLE` to the issuer account
`AccountFlags`.

The flag may be set or unset on any account as long as that account has not set
the `AUTH_IMMUTABLE` flag.

The flag does not require any other flags to be set on the account and other
flags may be set without conflict. However, an issuer account will only be able
to guarantee clawback if the issuer account also has the `AUTH_REQUIRED` and
`AUTH_REVOCABLE` flags set. If these flags are not set the issuer account will
only be able to clawback asset amounts that are not bound to selling
liabilities.
 
#### Clawback Operation
The `ClawbackOp` operation reduces the balance of the asset in the account by
the specified amount of the specific `asset` from the `from` account,
effectively returning it to the issuer account, burning it.

Similar to other operations the clawback operation will fail if the account
balance is less than the amount specified when account for selling liabilities.
If clawback is required of asset amounts locked up with selling liabilities then
the issuer may use the `AllowTrustOp` operation to revoke authorization of the
trustline, which will cancel any existing ledger entries creating selling
liabilities, such as offers, and issue the `ClawbackOp` in the same operation.
If the issuer wishes to allow the `from` account to continue utilizing the asset
it can include another `AllowTrustOp` after the `ClawbackOp` to authorize the
account once again.

Similar to the limitations of the `AllowTrustOp`'s ability to revoke a trustline
for an asset, the `ClawbackOp` can only affect a trustline held in an account,
and not an asset held in a `BalanceEntry`.

Possible return values for the `ClawbackOp` are:
- `CLAWBACK_SUCCESS` if the clawback is successful.
- `CLAWBACK_MALFORMED` if the `asset` value is malformed or `amount` is < 1.
- `CLAWBACK_NO_TRUST` if the `from` account does not have a trustline for
  `asset`.
- `CLAWBACK_DISABLED` if the `CLAWBACK_ENABLED` flag is not set on the issuer
  account.
- `CLAWBACK_UNDERFUNDED` if the `from` account does not have sufficient
  available balance of `asset` after accounting for selling liabilities.

## Design Rationale

In the event of regulatory action, erroneous transaction, or loss of custody,
the issuer may conduct a clawback transaction if the `AUTH_CLAWBACKABLE` flag is 
set. In the event of loss of custody, the affected party would need to 
demonstrate they are the rightful owner of the account (usually through 
reproofing KYC credentials or otherwise authenticating). On obtaining this 
proof, the issuer could execute a clawback from the lost account followed by a
subsequent payment to a separate account under control of the affected party. 
Needless to say, executing a reallocation is a significant responsibility and 
in many cases should be reserved for licensed entities (like a transfer agent) 
holding the issuer credentials and aware of responsibilities under the law of 
the jurisdiction of the affected party and asset. 
 
The account `AUTH_CLAWBACKABLE` flag allows the issuer to designate the asset as a
non-bearer instrument asset. By including the `AUTH_CLAWBACKABLE` flag in Asset
flags, account owners may review the revocability of an asset and have the
choice to avoid this type of asset if they object to the implied trust in the
issuer.
 
## Protocol Upgrade Transition

### Backwards Incompatibilities

The change does not have an affect on previous assets, accounts, or transaction 
structure. It should not cause a breaking change in existing implementations.
